        <div class="container-fluid">
    <p> Greenland is a sparsely populated country hence its emissions are still low compared with many other countries.
        Even so, Greenland has taken steps to move the country into a more sustainable direction by increasing awareness
        about climate change and to lessen the overall CO2 emissions. The government of Greenland has initiated ambitions of
        becoming a sustainable island with 90% renewable energy by 2030 such as implementing solar cells to its smaller cities. Currently Greenland has
        five hydropower plants (generated by flowing water) providing electricity to its larger cities including it's capital
        Nuuk, but the smaller cities and remote villages heating and electricity needs are powered only by diesel, which is distilled from 
        crude oil- a form of fossil fuel.

        <ol><li>Blanket key parts of the ice sheet in millions of hollow, glass microspheres, proposed by a non-profit organization Ice911. The purpose of these microspheres is to create a
            greater
            reflection of sunlight to shield the ice from melting. These tiny grain like microspheres are made from
            silicon and oxygen to create a compound of silica.
            They are functionally useful in that they don't blow away easy as they effectively stick to the surfaces of
            the ice as well as water on contact and because
            of their chemical composition it also ensures that they deflect oil-based pollutants. The team aims to only
            cover specific areas of the hotspot regions of the ice sheet.
            Pilot trials have already been tested in a smaller frozen lake in Alaska. Not only did these silica beads
            increase ice reflectivity but it also was successful in
            lowering temperatures and restoring the thickness of the ice.</li>  
            <li>Refreeze the Arctic
                Proposed by an Indonesian architect Faris R. Kotahatuhaha. This method would involve a submarine that
                collects the water and desalinates it to
                refreeze only the melted freshwater. Thereby producing artificial iceblocks in a hexagonal shape and combine
                and interlock them with the frozen masses. </li> 
     
                <li> Building a Dam
                    Submerged barriers or dams to be built in front of ice sheets and glaciers to contain the meltwater from
                    being lost in the ocean and also in turn reducing sea levels to rise.
                    It also restricts the ice from eroding through outside influences as it comes into contact with the flow of
                    warmer seawater with its ice shelves to prevent further melting.</li>
          <li>  Creating subglacial tunnels
            This is created by boring vast tunnels in the underwater bottom ice regions so that cold water can be pumped into it in order 
            to thicken it and prevent it sliding into the ocean.  </li>

        <h4><u>Analysis on the Response & Initiatives</u></h4>

        <p> Greenland's continuous efforts on a municipal and national level is
            beneficial
            for long term ice replenishment and environmental sustainability. Implementing solar cells will definitely reduce the need to import diesel to
            the smaller cities
            and villages. The cost of solar cells are gradually being reduced drastically over the years and so the gains will be efficient 
            instead of not switching to solar cells.
            Expanding the use of green energy such as solar cells into being utilized in the smaller cities, will be
            especially optimal
            in the south, where there is are continuous daylight conditions for large part of the year.
            

    <p>In terms of international efforts so far all of the relief efforts to prevent the ice sheets from melting are
        still in preliminary stages. They would still require extensive research and funding,
        the execution process of these initiatives can cost up to billions of dollars, e.g. scattering the silica
        microspheres on a meaningful and on a large scale
        is estimated to cost up to $5 billion. Assessing all the ideas and proposals, it seems that the non-profit
        organization of Ice911 of using small beads to
        reflect sunlight is the furthest along out of all the proposed options. It is also the one that would cause the
        least amount of man-made interference for example boring through the bottom of the ice to build underwater tunnels will extensively alter or even damage the
        overall natural structure of the ice sheets. </p>
