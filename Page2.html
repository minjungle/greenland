                    Positioned in the Arctic, Greenland's Ice Sheet has become the epicenter of climate change; and it's
                    melting
                    rapidly before our very eyes...
                </i>
            </h6>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Greenland's ice sheet is currently melting 6-7 times faster than it was back
                in the 1980's. </li>

            <li> Since 1993, Greenland has cumulatively lost 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice into
                the ocean.</li>
            <li> One trillion ton being lost in between the years 2011-2014 alone.</li>
            <li>Greenland is the biggest contributor to sea level rise. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These uncharacteristically warmer conditions surrounding Greenland and the Arctic means that it
            affects the
            local community comprised of indigenous hunters especially those that rely on sled dogs or
            snowmobiles to
            traverse
            across
            the vast fields of ice.
            This affects their livelihood and future generations of local indigenous hunters may
            be no
            more.
            It is likely that a continued trend of accelerated melting rates will cause the sea levels to rise
            even
            further and
            will
            inevitably pose many other serious ecological repercussions.

            <h4> Human Causes: 'Global Warming and the Greenland Ice Sheet'</h4>

            <p> The great glacial melt is massively linked to human implications, we have become a great force of nature
                in melting the ice sheets. Scientific data show that since the industrial revolution, human activities
                have greatly intensified the melting of glaciers every time we burn fossil fuels.
                Humans have added a layer of excess carbon dioxide that lingers in our atmosphere trapping even more
                heat energy from the sun, forcing the earth's glaciers to retreat and disappear at unprecedented rates.
                Emissions of carbon dioxide Co2 are particulary connected to our need for heating, transportation,
                manufacturing and supplies.
                Deforestation is also a major source on the levels of carbon dioxide, less trees means that less carbon
                dioxide is absorbed from the earth's atmosphere. </P>

            <h4>Natural Causes </h4>

            <div>
                <p>
                    <u>Positive Feedback Loops:</u> The rise in recent global air and ocean temperatures due to the greenhouse
                    effect have created and triggered a positive feedback loop that continually melts within the ice
                    sheet in a vicious cycle. The ocean acts as a giant heat sink
                    and absorbs more than 90% of the Earth's warmth. The earth's global temperature rises -> ice melts in greater
                    proportions -> albedo drops which
                    means less
                    overall ice reflectivity -> more solar radiation is absorbed and soaked up by the open water ->
                    further warming up waters -> melting the
                    ice and the cycle repeats. ->
                    The cyclical nature of this postive feedback loop has caused the melting rate has outpaced the
                    recovery
                    rate.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <u>Algae Blooms:</u> The darkening of the Greenland Ice Sheet is caused by algae blooms also known as 'glacier
                    algae.' They normally live on the upper few centimetres
                    towards the surface of the ice and have created many widespread blooms along the southwest regions of
                    the
                    ice sheet. Due to their protective darker pigmentation
                    used as a survival mechanism it absorbs more sunlight energy that leads to increased melting rates when
                    they
                    collectively come together to create these colonies of 'Dark Zones'
                    this becomes an amplified problem during the summer season. The proliferation of these microbial
                    extremophiles are changing the reflectivity of the ice sheet, they are essentially
                    capturing the sun's heat and light energy helping the ice to warm up and melt in rapid levels.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <u>Melt Lakes and Streams:</u> Because of the blue waters of the melt lakes and streams that form on the surface
                    of
                    the ice sheet,
                    it absorbs the sunlight in greater amounts unlike the white ice that reflects the solar rays, contributing
                    to a
                    higher level of melting.
                    Not only that, oftentimes the meltwater would seep and flow down through the cracks of the ice sheet all the
                    way
                    down to the bottom of the bedrock, melting the ice from the inside out, this may act as a lubricant for the
                    glacier to slide
                    which may cause an irreversible change.
